  "diet_recommendations": "## RECOMMENDED DIET\nThe Pescatarian Diet with an emphasis on iron and vitamin B-rich foods.\n\n## WHY THIS DIET\nThis diet approach is recommended because it excludes beef, respecting Nikhil's Hindu dietary preference, and includes fish and poultry, which are rich in iron and vitamin B. The pescatarian diet also offers a variety of food options that are moderate in budget and can be prepared within 15-30 minutes, aligning with Nikhil's preferences. By focusing on iron and vitamin B-rich foods, this diet aims to address Nikhil's low iron and vitamin B levels.\n\n## FOODS TO INCLUDE\n- Chicken breast\n- Fish (such as salmon or tuna)\n- Spinach\n- Quinoa\n- Brown rice\n- Lentils\n- Chickpeas\n- Avocado\n- Olive oil\n- Sunflower seeds\n- Pumpkin seeds\n- Turkey bacon\n- Shrimp\n- Sweet potatoes\n\n## FOODS TO AVOID\n- Beef\n- Eggs\n- Soy products\n- Dairy products\n- Tree nuts (such as almonds, walnuts, etc.)\n- Pork\n- Lamb\n- High-sugar foods\n- Processed meats\n- Fried foods\n- Foods high in saturated fats\n\n## MEAL TIMING\nEat 4-5 main meals and 2-3 snacks in between, spaced out every 2-3 hours, to maintain a stable energy level and support weight loss.
