  "diet_recommendations": "## RECOMMENDED DIET\nGiven Nikhil's profile and health status, I recommend a modified version of the Mediterranean Diet, tailored to accommodate his non-vegetarian preferences, allergies, and religious dietary restrictions. This diet will be referred to as the \"Modified Mediterranean Diet for Nikhil.\"\n\n## WHY THIS DIET\nThe Modified Mediterranean Diet for Nikhil is chosen because it emphasizes whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats, which are beneficial for overall health and weight management. It also allows for the inclusion of non-vegetarian protein sources that are not beef, accommodating Nikhil's Hindu dietary preference. This diet is flexible and can be adapted to exclude tree nuts, eggs, soy, and dairy, which Nikhil is allergic to.\n\n## FOODS TO INCLUDE\n- Chicken breast\n- Fish (such as salmon or tilapia)\n- Lamb\n- Turkey\n- Quinoa\n- Brown rice\n- Oats\n- Avocado\n- Olive oil\n- Coconut oil\n- Apples\n- Bananas\n- Carrots\n- Broccoli\n- Sweet potatoes\n\n## FOODS TO AVOID\n- Beef\n- Pork\n- Tree nuts (such as almonds, walnuts)\n- Eggs\n- Soy products (including tofu and edamame)\n- Dairy products (including milk, cheese, yogurt)\n- Processed meats (like sausages and bacon)\n- Refined sugars\n- White bread\n- Fried foods\n- High-sodium foods\n\n## MEAL TIMING\nNikhil should aim to eat 4-5 main meals and snacks throughout the day, spaced out every 3-4 hours. This includes breakfast, lunch, dinner, and 1-2 snacks in between. Given his light activity level, it's essential to balance calorie intake with expenditure to support weight loss.\n\n## KEY NUTRIENTS\nFor Nikhil, key nutrients to focus on include:\n- Protein from non-beef, non-dairy sources to support muscle health and satiety.\n- Fiber from whole grains, fruits, and vegetables to aid in digestion and feeling full.\n- Healthy fats like those found in avocado, olive oil, and coconut oil for energy and nutrient absorption.\n- Vitamin and mineral supplements may be considered to fill any nutritional gaps, especially given the dietary restrictions.\n\n## HYDRATION\nNikhil should aim to drink at least 8-10 glasses of water per day. Additionally, he can include other fluids like herbal teas and freshly squeezed juices (without added sugars) to meet his hydration needs.\n\n## LIFESTYLE TIPS\n1. **Regular Physical Activity**: Engage in light to moderate physical activity for at least 30 minutes a day, such as brisk walking, to support weight loss and overall health.\n2. **Portion Control**: Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid overeating and to manage weight effectively.\n3. **Stress Management**: Practice stress-reducing techniques like meditation or yoga to help manage stress, which can impact eating habits and weight.\n4. **Sleep**: Ensure 7-8 hours of sleep per night to support metabolism and weight regulation.\n5. **Follow-up Appointments**: Regularly follow up with your healthcare provider to monitor progress and address any concerns or symptoms that may arise.",
